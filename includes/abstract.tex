This thesis sets out to implement keyword-spotting on the UltraTrail architecture.
One additional goal is extending the Rust ecosystem by adding support for UltraTrail to Rust.
To achive this, UltraTrail is added to the PAC and its drivers are implmented in the HAL.
Then the implementation of the $I^2S$ and PDM drivers are tested.
Testing reveals that the microphone drivers do not work as expected.
While fixing a few bugs, it was not possible to get the microphones working as
desired, so keyword-spotting could not be implemented.
However the UltraTrail driver has successfully been implemented and tested.
