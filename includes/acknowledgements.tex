I want to thank my parents for helping me finance studying abroad.
Also, a big thank-you goes out to all the people that took the time
and put in the effort to read through my thesis and give me their feedback.
So thank you, Felix, In√©s, Abdu and Luis.
Finally, a big thank-you to my supervisor Christoph Gross, as well
as Adrian Frischknecht and Paul Palomero Bernardo who helped me
with this thesis and put up with all my questions.
