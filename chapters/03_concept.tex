Rust \cite{rustlang} is a somewhat new language,
with their very first release in early 2012 \cite{rust_releases}.
But the 1.0 alpha release was only in early 2015 \cite{rust_releases}
with the full 1.0 release following a few months later in Mai of the same year \cite{rust_releases}.
C, as a comparison has been used as early as the 1970s.\\
But Rust has been gaining in popularity \cite{rust_popularity} over the last few years, but
due to it's relatively 'young' age there still are huge gaps when it comes to software support and available libraries.
So in my thesis I'll improve upon the Rust eco-system by expanding upon the thesis of Raphael Vogelgsang \cite{raphael}
and implementing support for the UltraTrail \cite{ultratrail} AI accelerator.
