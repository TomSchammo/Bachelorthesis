### Windows 10/11

* Install [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download) and make sure it is added to the `Path`
* Install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) (necessary for `make`/`latexmk`) add to path to `bin` to `Path` environment variable manually
* Install [GnuWin32 Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
	* download the binaries unzip them and copy them to `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32` (`GnuWin32` folder has to be created first)
	* Add to path to `bin` to `Path` environment variable manually

Compile from command line:
```
cd thesis-template
make
```

View without pdf file lock
```
cd thesis-template
start texworks .\output\thesis.pdf
```

#### Add to `Path` Environment Variable
* Press [Win]+[R]
* Enter `sysdm.cpl`
* Choose Tab _Advanced_
* Click on _Environment Variables_
* Select `Path`
* Click _Edit_
* Click _New_
* Enter the path to the binaries that should be added to the `Path` Environment Variable
* Close all windows/dialogs by pressing _OK_
* Restart your terminal such that the changes are applied

### macOS

* Install [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex-mac)
* Install `make`:
```
xcode-select --install
```

Compile from command line:
```
cd thesis-template
make
```

### Overleaf
* Login to Overleaf
* Create a new _Blank Project_
* Create the folders: `chapters`, `figures`, `includes`
* Upload the files from the local folders into the overleaf folders
* Delete the `main.tex`
* Upload the `thesis.tex`
* Press _Recompile_

### VS Code
* To use VS Code like other LaTeX dedicated editors (e.g. TeX Studio) you can use the extension [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop).
* With the current settings in `.vscode/settings.json` the compile process will be initiated whenever a file is saved.
* The default recipe (also specified in `setting.json`) will make sure that all files generated during compilation will end up in the `output` directory.
* Sometimes the compile process hangs in the "Build Stage" (e.g. if there is a syntax error in the document). This can be seen on the left side in the status bar at the bottom of VS code. If this happens you can manually stop compilation:
  * Open the LaTeX Workshop extension menu
  * In the commands section open the "Build LaTeX project" section
  * Use "Terminate current compilation"
* In the extension menu you will also find the compiler log messages indicating why the compilation didn't finish in the first place.

Note: You can still use `make` in the terminal to compile your thesis document.

## Language Selection ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

By default this thesis template is set to English. To switch to German do the following:
* in [includes/packages.tex](./includes/packages.tex) remove `english` from the following line:
```
\usepackage[ngerman,english]{babel}
```
* in [includes/definitions.tex](./includes/definitions.tex) set the variable `english` under _Variable declarations_ to `false`:
```
\setboolean{english}{false}
```
